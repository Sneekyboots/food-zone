## Food Delivery App - React Native (Expo) with Sanity

This project is a fully built, native React application for food delivery that utilizes Sanity for a headless CMS.

**Tech Stack:**

* React Native
* Expo
* Sanity

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.
* A Sanity project set up and running.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-delivery-app.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd food-delivery-app
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure Sanity:

   - Update the `sanity.config.js` file with your Sanity project details (dataset, project ID, etc.).

4. Run the app:

   This will start the Expo development server and open the app in a simulator or on your device.

**Features:**
